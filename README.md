## Project Purpose

American River College is a community college, and as such, it does not want to spend the money it has on upgrading its business systems.
On such system is an ancient PeopleSoft website, lacking in many quality-of-life features which would make it pleasant to use.
In order to extract any useful budgetary information, the user would have to submit several queries, remember the results, and input them into other forms.
This process is needlessly tedious, and so this project was created to automate much of the process.
