# PSDataImprovementSelenium

An automation program used to speed up the American River College business systems.

## Project Purpose

American River College is a community college, and as such, it does not want to spend the money it has on upgrading its business systems.
On such system is an ancient PeopleSoft website, lacking in many quality-of-life features which would make it pleasant to use.
In order to extract any useful budgetary information, the user would have to submit several queries, remember the results, and input them into other forms.
This process is needlessly tedious, and so this project was created to automate much of the process.

## Getting Started

Currently, the project only runs in Netbeans IDE 8.2, and is untested in other versions of the IDE.

### Prerequisites

You will need Netbeans IDE version 8.2 with the Gradle plugin installed to run the project.
Obviously, Java is needed to allow the project to run.
You will also need to download the Google Chrome WebDriver for your version of Chrome [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
You can find your version by going to the "Customize and Control Google Chrome" button (triple dots) on the right-hand side of your Chrome browser, and click on Help->About Google Chrome.

### Installing

Download and unzip the repository, and open it in NetBeans. 

## Built With

* [Selenium](https://selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/index.html) - The automation framework used
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Build tool
